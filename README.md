# Content Management System

Welcome to my [Content Management System](https://content-management-system-32ddcdcefaf8.herokuapp.com/)!

This project is built with Next.js, React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and a MySQL database hosted through JawsDB. It is deployed on Heroku. JWT is used for session cookie encryption and bcrypt is used for secure password hashing. 

This project contains implemented authorization, profiles for users, groups where users can share/store posts and media, and other pages that support the profile and group functionality such as the join group page, create group page, page not found pages, and more.
