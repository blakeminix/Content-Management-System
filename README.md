# Content Management System

Welcome to my [Content Management System](https://content-management-system-32ddcdcefaf8.herokuapp.com/)!

This project was built with Next.js, React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and a MySQL database hosted through JawsDB. It was deployed on Heroku. JWT is used for session cookie encryption and bcrypt is used for secure password hashing. 

This project contains implemented authorization, profiles for users, groups where users can share/store posts and media, and other pages that support the profile and group functionality such as the join group, create group, and page not found pages.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
